The NYU-6463-RV32I processor is a 32-bit architecture which executes a subset of the open source RISC-V RV32I
instruction set. There are three main instruction types: 
- computational operations (from register file to register
file), 
- load/store between memory and register file
- control flow (jumps and branches to different parts of
code)
